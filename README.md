# Cloud Computing with Java

started with https://start.spring.io/ and

- Project: Gradle - Kotlin
- Language: Java
- Spring Boot: 3.4.0
- Packaging: Jar
- Java: 21

# Rationale

The "Cloud" is a diverse set (graph) of computers (nodes)
with communication links (edges).

One and the same Java bytecode can run on nodes with different processor,
system, and operating system architectures,
as long as there is a compliant JVM implementation.

Java applications can communicate with the cloud through the standard library
and an ecosystem of public Java libraries.

# Develop

- Run with `./gradlew bootRun [--args='<arguments>']`
