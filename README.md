# Cloud Computing with Java

started with https://start.spring.io/ and

- Project: Gradle - Kotlin
- Language: Java
- Spring Boot: 3.4.0
- Packaging: Jar
- Java: 21

# Rationale

The "Cloud" is a diverse graph of nodes (computers)
with links (communication).

One and the same Java bytecode can run on nodes with different processor,
system, and operating system architectures,
as long as there is a compliant JVM implementation.

# Develop

- Run with `./gradlew bootRun --args=''`
